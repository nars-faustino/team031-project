NOTE all the best parameters in this folder were exported after a performing a
16 parameter grid search and minimizing the MAPE from a 10 fold forward chaining
cross validation for every valid flight.

Run "cv_mape_import_calc.py" to find the average, min, and max CV MAPEs across
all valid flights for the 3 airfares: "fare", "fare_lg", and "fare_low".
