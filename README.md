# Team 31 - Spring 2025

* Webapp is designed to run on Python 3.12 & the only libraries used are **pandas** and **bokeh** so far.

* Download the CSVs / JSONs from Google Drive into the /data folder.
  
* When coding, the webapp is designed so you have access to `processed-data.csv` via `self.df` within any function in the AirlineApp class. Use this to build any visualizations / model inference needed.
